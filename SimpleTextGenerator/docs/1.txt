In UML, an activity diagram is used to display the sequence of activities. Activity diagrams show the workflow from a start point to the finish point detailing the many decision paths that exist in the progression of events contained in the activity. They may be used to detail situations where parallel processing may occur in the execution of some activities. Activity diagrams are useful for business modelling where they are used for detailing the processes involved in business activities.
An activity is the specification of a parameterized sequence of behaviour. An activity is shown as a round-cornered rectangle enclosing all the actions, control flows and other elements that make up the activity.
